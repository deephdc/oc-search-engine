        "Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of",
        "data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. This citizen-researcher relationship",
        "creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects. ",
        "With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify conus marine snails at species ",
        "level [1] in collaboration with the [Natural Science Museum of Madrid](http://www.mncn.csic.es/). The taxonomy ",
        "of these snails has changed significantly several times during recent years and the introduction of Deep Learning",
        "techniques allowing to classify them is a very valuable tool for the experts.\n",

        "This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for conus identification using",
        "images. The architecture used is an ResNet50 [2] network using Lasagne on top of Theano.\n",

        "The training dataset has been provided by the [Natural Science Museum of Madrid](http://www.mncn.csic.es/) and ",
        "it consists on a dataset containing images of 68 species of conus covering three different regions: the Panamic ",
        "region; the South African region; and the Western Atlantic and Mediterranean region.\n",
