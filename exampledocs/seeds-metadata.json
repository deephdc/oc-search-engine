        "Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of",
        "data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. This citizen-researcher relationship",
        "creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects. ",
        "With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify seed images in collaboration ",

        "which consists of around 28K images from 743 species and 493 genera.\n",
