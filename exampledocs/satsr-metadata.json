        "With the latest missions launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)",
        "equipped with the latest technologies in multi-spectral sensors, we face an unprecedented amount of data with spatial and",
        "temporal resolutions never reached before. Exploring the potential of this data with state-of-the-art AI techniques like",
        "Deep Learning, could potentially change the way we think about and protect our planet's resources.\n",

        "This Docker container contains  a plug-and-play tool to perform super-resolution on satellite imagery.",
        "It uses Deep Learning to provide a better performing alternative to classical pansharpening (more details in [1]).\n",

        "Right now we are supporting super-resolution for the following satellites:",
        "* [Sentinel 2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)",
        "* [Landsat 8](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/)",
        "* [VIIRS](https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/)",
        "* [MODIS](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/modis)\n",

        "More information on the satellites and processing levels that are supported can be found [here](https://github.com/deephdc/satsr/blob/master/reports/additional_notes.md)",
        "along with some [demo images](https://github.com/deephdc/satsr/tree/master/reports/figures) of the super-resolutions performed in non-training data.\n",
        "If you want to perform super-resolution on another satellite, go to the [training section](https://github.com/deephdc/satsr#train-other-satellites)",
        "to see how you can easily add support for additional satellites. We are happy to accept PRs!\n",
